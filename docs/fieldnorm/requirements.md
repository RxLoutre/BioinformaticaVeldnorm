# Requirements in software development
The complexity and variety of developments in the field of bioinformatics, comes with a need for clear prerequisites before the start of a project. These requirements of software should describe the prerequisites that the software should meet. The requirements should be stated as clear and complete as possible before starting on a project. Additionally, requirements should be stated in broad and unspecific form, as to not limit the bioinformatician too much when developing the software. The requirements may relate to several aspects, including:
- the performance of the desired software
- the computing environment
- compatibility
- input- and output-formats
- interfaces to other systems
- communication from the software
- security requirements
- user interfaces to the software
- data definitions
- installation and acceptance requirements
- requirements related to the methods of operation and maintenance
- network-related requirements
- user maintenance requirements
- regulatory requirements

All software development teams should have a standardized and documented approach for gathering requirements.The requirements may (and are likely to) change during the process, however, it is encouraged to evaluate if the project is still in line with the original requirements, so that 'scope creep' is prevented.  Requirements can come from end-users, bio-informaticians and other stakeholders, and they should be discussed between all of them before adding, removing or altering them. It is recommended to express the requirements in a form that is SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound). It is essential to track these requirements throughout the development process (e.g. in JIRA, Confluence or GitHub/GitLab). Once these requirements have been implemented as features in the software, they should be validated before the release is used in production.
